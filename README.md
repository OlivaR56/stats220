# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in chemistry.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I previously did stats 101 and found I enjoyed the course and so decieded to try 220 also.
- I am interested in learning building on my current statistics knowledge and programming.

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://c.tenor.com/8druEACXtX8AAAAd/tenor.gif)
